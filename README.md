This Rmarkdown [article](https://nickwisniewski.com/sleeptracker/article_3-device.html) contains an analysis of measurements recorded simultaneously recorded using 3 consumer sleep trackers. 

# Abstract

We compared 3 sleep trackers (Oura Ring, Withings Sleep, and Fitbit Charge 3) and their ability to measure total sleep, deep sleep, REM sleep, and light sleep. We found significant differences across devices for all 4 measurements. Furthermore, we found no correlation between the amount of deep sleep measured by the 3 devices, and only mild correlation between REM sleep measurements. We concluded that current sleep trackers are only capable of measuring total sleep.
