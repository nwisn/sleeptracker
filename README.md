# sleeptracker

This Rmarkdown notebook (https://nickwisniewski.com/sleeptracker/article_3-device.html) contains an analysis of measurements recorded simultaneously recorded using 3 consumer sleep trackers. We compared their ability to measure total sleep, deep sleep, REM sleep, and light sleep. We found significant differences across devices for all 4 measurements. Furthermore, we found no correlation between the amount of deep sleep measured by the 3 devices, and only mild correlation between REM sleep measurements. We concluded that current sleep trackers are only capable of measuring total sleep.
